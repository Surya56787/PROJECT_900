        The console sceen is where you can display things on your screen. We use it to display messages so others can enjoy the app. To open the console screen all you need to do is to press the go live button to see wahtyou have made!

        var first_name = "Surya ";
        var last_name="Gunda";
        var full_name=first_name.concat(last_name);
        console.log(full_name);
        var squareroot=Math.sqrt(100);
        console.log(squareroot);
        var a=78;
        var b=98;
        var subtract = a-b;
        console.log(subtract);
